# LED Icosahedron
![Icosahedron](http://www.4k2.de/ikosaeder/img/ikosaeder_final.jpg "LED Icosahedron")

This is the Arduino sketch for my first LED Icosahedron.
The LED part is explained on my [homepage](http://www.4k2.de/ikosaeder).

The sources are hosted on

Variants of the icosahedron are in the other branches:

# Schematic
Connect the 7 LED wires (via 220Î©) with the output pins D8, D9, D2, D3, D4 and D5.
Pin D7 is unused in this sketch.

Using the auto-off powercontrol with DC-DC converter is optional:
