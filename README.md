This is the Arduino sketch for the second LED Icosahedron.
The LED part is explained on my [homepage](http://www.4k2.de/ikosaeder).

The sources are hosted on
https://github.com/jensh/ArduinoLedIkosaeder/tree/ikosaeder2 in branch
ikosaeder2. Variants of the icosahedron are in the other branches.

# Schematic
Connect the 6 LED wires (via 220Î©) with the output pins D2, D3, D4, D5, D6 and D7.
Pin D8 and D9 are unused in this sketch.

Using the auto-off powercontrol with DC-DC converter is optional:
